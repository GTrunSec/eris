=head1 NAME

eris -- an easy to use binary cache for the Nix package manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<eris> <I<-f|-s>>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<eris> is a easy to use "binary cache" for the Nix package manager: it exports
your Nix store over an HTTP link, allowing you to download objects located on
other machines.

=head1 BASIC USAGE AND CONFIGURATION

When Eris starts up, it reads a configuration file, and begins executing in one
of two modes, controlled by command line options: daemon mode, the default if
no arguments are provided, or foreground mode, if the B<--foreground> command
line option is given.

Daemon mode forks a process and writes its PID to the CWD. This process can
later be stopped by using the B<--stop> command line option in the same CWD.

In either mode, a configuration file located in the CWD named B<eris.conf> will
be read and applied. Its options and format are described below.

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

Eris uses the L<hypnotoad(8)> server included with Mojolicious for deployment,
and by default exports two main command line options to control Hypnotoad
startup.

=over

=item B<-f>, B<--foreground>

Start the server in the foreground, as opposed to forking a daemon process (the
default mode).

=item B<-s>, B<--stop>

Stop the server (previously started in daemon mode, i.e. with no command line
parameters) gracefully.
